title: War in the Belly
description: >-
  When I was young, I once fell ill and was hospitalized. At that time, there
  were no doctors in the hospital; all the medical staff came from worker,
  peasant, and soldier backgrounds — the real doctors had all gone to various
  teams to receive re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants.
